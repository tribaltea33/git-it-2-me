  <p>It's time to accept the way I am and see why God needs this individual on the planet.
    The importance of self acceptance is to save time and focus on spending the rest of my years being of service.
    Asking - What is it I believe is the best way to live, and how am I to fit into that way of living?
    The ultimate question being: "Please God, how can I be of use?"</p>

  <h2>How I'm Living</h2>
  <p>In the past three years I have moved seven times looking for a home. My workplace just let me go of my job as
    a canvasser for wall cavity and loft insulation, due to the coronavirus outbreak.
    I feel free now. Sales roles are a prison. I often end up in cities where the jobs are but I belong in the countryside, as I grew up
    in it. I have £743 in my bank account and feel it's enough right now. Since the outbreak,
    I have felt a tremendous sense of relief from city and working life pressure. This letting go comes from the sense that most of the
    country is having to have some kind of break from capitalism and intense working and commuting competition.</p>
  <h2>How I Dream to Live</h2>
  <p>My dream is to live in a way which is self suffcient. I would love to live in a community which isn't expressed or
    advertised as one, but where living this way is just a way of life. We would work with the land but it is also absolutely fine to work
    outside of the community too. We would contribute a percentage of our salaries into the village. In my dream, it would be a Christian
    community with regular gatherings but completely separate households. This would be in a natural landscape and we would use permaculture
    principles to pay respects to the land. It would maybe hold 20 families and the households would be self built.</p>

    <li>Great drive</li>
